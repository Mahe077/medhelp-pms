# Theme Concept: Futuristic Medical (Deep Medic)

The Pharmacy Management System (PMS) utilizes a design language termed **"Futuristic Medical"** or **"Deep Medic"**. This theme balances the clean, clinical necessity of medical software with a modern, high-tech aesthetic.

## Core Principles

1.  **Clinical Clarity**: Information must be legible and primary actions must be obvious.
2.  **High-Tech Aesthetic**: Utilization of glassmorphism, subtle gradients, and holographic grids.
3.  **Responsive Feedback**: Micro-animations and transitions guide the user's attention.

## Color Palette

The theme uses `oklch` colors for superior perceptual uniformity.

### Light Mode (Clean & Clinical)

- **Primary**: `oklch(0.65 0.25 160)` (Medical Green) - Represents health, vitality, and safety.
- **Background**: `oklch(0.99 0.01 200)` - Extremely light teal-white to reduce eye strain.
- **Accents**: Subtle teal shadows and soft borders.

### Dark Mode (Deep Medic)

- **Primary**: `oklch(0.75 0.25 155)` (Neon Bio-Green) - High contrast against dark backgrounds.
- **Background**: `oklch(0.12 0.02 210)` - Deep Slate/Teal base for a premium, laboratory feel.
- **Surface**: `oklch(0.15 0.03 210 / 0.8)` - Glassmorphism panels.

## Typography

- **Headings & UI**: `Inter` - Highly legible sans-serif.
- **Data & Codes**: `Fira Code` - Monospace for SKU numbers, doses, and technical data.

## Design Elements

### Glassmorphism

Panels use backdrop-blur and semi-transparent backgrounds to create depth without clutter.

### Holographic Grid

A subtle radial-gradient grid in the background provides a sense of structure and a high-tech "digital lab" atmosphere.

### Iconography

Clean, thin-line icons with glowing accents when hovered.
